      In 2014, the teachers behind the Association of Chartered Teachers Scotland (ACTS) stepped into the future
      by relaunching as Scottish Teachers for Enhancing Practice (STEP).
    %p
      The new organisation, which was formally approved at a meeting on 1st March 2014, was intended to have a
      broader appeal as membership would be open to all teachers wishing to enhance their practice, not just
      Chartered Teachers. Andrina Inglis, the Chair of STEP at the time, said: "Now that the Chartered Teacher
      scheme has ended, we felt our organisation needed to look to the future and become more inclusive. By
      relaunching as STEP, we feel membership will interest a large number of teachers who are keen to improve
      their practice."
    %p
      Professional update is a key issue for all teachers, and STEP, with its annual conference attracting a
      range of highly regarded educational speakers, has a key role to play.
