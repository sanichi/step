Please analyze this codebase and create an AGENTS.md file containing:
1. Build/lint/test commands - especially for running a single test
2. Code style guidelines including imports, formatting, types, naming conventions, error handling, etc.

The file you create will be given to agentic coding agents (such as yourself) that operate in this repository. Make it about 20 lines long.
If there are Cursor rules (in .cursor/rules/ or .cursorrules) or Copilot rules (in .github/copilot-instructions.md), make sure to include them.

If there's already an AGENTS.md, improve it if it's located in /Users/mjo/Projects/app/step

I'll analyze this codebase to create an AGENTS.md file with build/lint/test commands and code style guidelines. Let me start by examining the project structure and configuration files.

Created `AGENTS.md` with build/test commands and code style guidelines for this Rails 8 conference website. The file covers RSpec testing (including single file/spec execution), Rails commands, and code conventions including HAML views, SASS stylesheets, dynamic routing patterns, and proper Rails architecture patterns observed in the codebase.

I'll analyze this Rails codebase and provide constructive feedback. Let me examine the code structure and patterns more thoroughly.

## Code Analysis & Comments

This is a well-structured Rails 8 application for a conference website. Here are my observations:

### **Strengths:**

1. **Clean Architecture**: Good separation of concerns with minimal controllers delegating to models
2. **Smart Rails Configuration**: Deliberately disabled unused Rails components (ActiveRecord, ActionMailbox, etc.) - shows thoughtful resource management
3. **Dynamic Routing**: Elegant use of ranges and arrays in `routes.rb` for generating similar route patterns
4. **Comprehensive Testing**: Good RSpec setup with Capybara for feature testing and proper I18n integration
5. **Modern Rails**: Uses Rails 8.0.2.1 with current best practices (importmaps, Turbo)

### **Areas for Improvement:**

1. **Image Model Complexity**: The `Image` class (app/models/image.rb:1-131) has grown quite large with complex navigation logic. Consider extracting the navigation logic into a separate service or breaking it into modules.

2. **File System Coupling**: The Image model directly accesses the file system (`Rails.root + "public" + "images"`). This makes testing harder and couples the model to the file structure. Consider using a configurable path or service layer.

3. **Hardcoded Logic**: Several hardcoded values in `allowed_dims` method (app/models/image.rb:104-105) for 2023 special case. This could be more maintainable with configuration.

4. **Missing Database**: No ActiveRecord suggests this is a static site, but some data (like conference years/info) might benefit from a lightweight data store for easier management.

5. **Duplicate View Files**: Many similar `conference_YYYY.html.haml` files could potentially be consolidated into a single dynamic template.

### **Minor Suggestions:**

- Consider adding error handling for missing images in the `Image` model
- The `env` action in PagesController uses shell commands that could be moved to a service for better testability
- Some view files use `.html` extension instead of `.haml` (e.g., `_facebook.html`, `_twitter.html`)

**Overall Assessment**: This is a solid, purposeful Rails application that demonstrates good understanding of the framework. The code is clean, well-tested, and appropriately scoped for its domain.
