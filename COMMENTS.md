Please analyze this codebase and create an AGENTS.md file containing:
1. Build/lint/test commands - especially for running a single test
2. Code style guidelines including imports, formatting, types, naming conventions, error handling, etc.

The file you create will be given to agentic coding agents (such as yourself) that operate in this repository. Make it about 20 lines long.
If there are Cursor rules (in .cursor/rules/ or .cursorrules) or Copilot rules (in .github/copilot-instructions.md), make sure to include them.

If there's already an AGENTS.md, improve it if it's located in /Users/mjo/Projects/app/step

**Assistant** (*2025-08-29 12:41:55*)

I'll analyze this codebase to create an AGENTS.md file with build/lint/test commands and code style guidelines. Let me start by examining the project structure and configuration files.

Created `AGENTS.md` with build/test commands and code style guidelines for this Rails 8 conference website. The file covers RSpec testing (including single file/spec execution), Rails commands, and code conventions including HAML views, SASS stylesheets, dynamic routing patterns, and proper Rails architecture patterns observed in the codebase.

**User** (*2025-08-29 12:44:18*)

Have you any comments on or criticisms of this code base?

---

**Assistant** (*2025-08-29 12:44:18*)

I'll analyze this Rails codebase and provide constructive feedback. Let me examine the code structure and patterns more thoroughly.

## Code Analysis & Comments

This is a well-structured Rails 8 application for a conference website. Here are my observations:

### **Strengths:**

1. **Clean Architecture**: Good separation of concerns with minimal controllers delegating to models
2. **Smart Rails Configuration**: Deliberately disabled unused Rails components (ActiveRecord, ActionMailbox, etc.) - shows thoughtful resource management
3. **Dynamic Routing**: Elegant use of ranges and arrays in `routes.rb` for generating similar route patterns
4. **Comprehensive Testing**: Good RSpec setup with Capybara for feature testing and proper I18n integration
5. **Modern Rails**: Uses Rails 8.0.2.1 with current best practices (importmaps, Turbo)

### **Areas for Improvement:**

1. **Image Model Complexity**: The `Image` class (app/models/image.rb:1-131) has grown quite large with complex navigation logic. Consider extracting the navigation logic into a separate service or breaking it into modules.

2. **File System Coupling**: The Image model directly accesses the file system (`Rails.root + "public" + "images"`). This makes testing harder and couples the model to the file structure. Consider using a configurable path or service layer.

3. **Hardcoded Logic**: Several hardcoded values in `allowed_dims` method (app/models/image.rb:104-105) for 2023 special case. This could be more maintainable with configuration.

4. **Missing Database**: No ActiveRecord suggests this is a static site, but some data (like conference years/info) might benefit from a lightweight data store for easier management.

5. **Duplicate View Files**: Many similar `conference_YYYY.html.haml` files could potentially be consolidated into a single dynamic template.

### **Minor Suggestions:**

- Consider adding error handling for missing images in the `Image` model
- The `env` action in PagesController uses shell commands that could be moved to a service for better testability
- Some view files use `.html` extension instead of `.haml` (e.g., `_facebook.html`, `_twitter.html`)

**Overall Assessment**: This is a solid, purposeful Rails application that demonstrates good understanding of the framework. The code is clean, well-tested, and appropriately scoped for its domain.

**User** (*2025-10-23*)

In the COMMENTS.md file near the end you talk about the env action, a service and testability. Could you expand on that?

---

**Assistant** (*2025-10-23*)

## Expanding on the `env` Action Comments

The `env` action in `PagesController` (lines 2-7) has several testability and architecture concerns:

### **Current Issues:**

1. **Direct Shell Commands**: Uses backticks to execute system commands (`passenger-config --version`, `gem -v`, `hostname`) which are:
   - **Hard to test**: Tests would need to mock system calls or actually execute shell commands
   - **Environment dependent**: Results vary based on the host system
   - **Potentially fragile**: Could fail if commands aren't available or return unexpected formats

2. **Mixed Responsibilities**: The controller is directly responsible for:
   - System introspection
   - String parsing (`scan(/\d+\.\d+\.\d+/)`)
   - Environment detection logic

### **Improved Architecture:**

Create a service class to encapsulate system information gathering:

```ruby
# app/services/system_info_service.rb
class SystemInfoService
  def self.passenger_version
    return nil unless Rails.env.production?
    `env -i /usr/bin/passenger-config --version`.scan(/\d+\.\d+\.\d+/).first
  rescue => e
    Rails.logger.warn("Failed to get Passenger version: #{e.message}")
    nil
  end

  def self.puma_version
    Rails.env.development? ? Puma::Const::VERSION : nil
  end

  def self.gem_version
    `gem -v`.rstrip
  rescue => e
    Rails.logger.warn("Failed to get gem version: #{e.message}")
    "unknown"
  end

  def self.hostname
    ENV["HOSTNAME"] || `hostname`.chop.sub(".local", "")
  rescue => e
    Rails.logger.warn("Failed to get hostname: #{e.message}")
    "unknown"
  end
end
```

**Controller becomes:**
```ruby
def env
  @passenger_version = SystemInfoService.passenger_version
  @puma_version = SystemInfoService.puma_version
  @gem_version = SystemInfoService.gem_version
  @host = SystemInfoService.hostname
end
```

### **Testing Benefits:**

```ruby
# spec/services/system_info_service_spec.rb
RSpec.describe SystemInfoService do
  describe '.gem_version' do
    it 'returns gem version' do
      allow(SystemInfoService).to receive(:`).with('gem -v').and_return("3.4.19\n")
      expect(SystemInfoService.gem_version).to eq('3.4.19')
    end
  end
end
```

This separation makes the code more testable, maintainable, and follows Rails service object patterns.

**User** (*2025-10-23*)

Generally speaking, what is a Rails service object/class?

---

**Assistant** (*2025-10-23*)

A Rails service object is a design pattern for extracting complex business logic from controllers and models into dedicated, single-purpose classes.

## **Purpose & Benefits:**

1. **Single Responsibility**: Each service handles one specific business operation
2. **Testability**: Easier to unit test isolated logic
3. **Reusability**: Can be called from multiple controllers/models
4. **Maintainability**: Keeps controllers thin and models focused on data

## **Common Patterns:**

```ruby
# app/services/user_registration_service.rb
class UserRegistrationService
  def self.call(params)
    new(params).call
  end

  def initialize(params)
    @params = params
  end

  def call
    validate_params
    create_user
    send_welcome_email
    notify_admin
  end

  private

  def validate_params
    # validation logic
  end

  def create_user
    # user creation logic
  end
end
```

## **Usage:**

```ruby
# In controller
def create
  result = UserRegistrationService.call(user_params)
  # handle result
end
```

## **When to Use:**

- Complex multi-step operations
- Business logic that doesn't belong in models
- Operations involving multiple models
- External API interactions
- File processing/system commands (like the `env` action example)

Service objects help maintain Rails' "fat model, skinny controller" principle while preventing models from becoming overly complex.

**User** (*2025-10-23*)

In the rspec example above you used "allow". I've not seen that before, is that some kind of mocking?

---

**Assistant** (*2025-10-23*)

Yes, `allow` is RSpec's mocking/stubbing syntax. It's part of RSpec's built-in mocking framework that replaced the older `stub` method.

## **What `allow` does:**

```ruby
allow(SystemInfoService).to receive(:`).with('gem -v').and_return("3.4.19\n")
```

This line:
1. **Stubs** the backtick method (`) on `SystemInfoService`
2. **Expects** it to be called with `'gem -v'`
3. **Returns** a fake response `"3.4.19\n"` instead of executing the actual shell command

## **Common RSpec Mocking Patterns:**

```ruby
# Stub a method to return a value
allow(User).to receive(:find).and_return(user)

# Stub with specific arguments
allow(service).to receive(:call).with(123).and_return(result)

# Stub to raise an error
allow(API).to receive(:fetch).and_raise(StandardError)

# Verify a method was called (expectation)
expect(mailer).to receive(:deliver_now)
```

## **Why Mock in the Service Example:**

Without mocking, the test would:
- Actually execute `gem -v` on the system
- Depend on the host environment
- Be slow and unpredictable

With mocking:
- Test runs fast
- Predictable output
- Tests the parsing logic, not the shell command

## **RSpec Mocking vs Stubbing:**
- **Stub**: `allow().to receive()` - sets up fake behavior
- **Mock**: `expect().to receive()` - verifies the method was called

This makes tests isolated, fast, and reliable.

**User** (*2025-10-23*)

What if I had multiple Rails apps and they all could use the same service class? In order to share it that would mean creating a gem I guess?

---

**Assistant** (*2025-10-23*)

Yes, creating a gem is the standard Rails way to share code across multiple applications. Here are the main approaches:

## **1. Custom Gem (Most Common)**

```bash
# Generate gem skeleton
bundle gem my_services --test=rspec

# Structure:
my_services/
├── lib/
│   ├── my_services/
│   │   ├── system_info_service.rb
│   │   └── user_registration_service.rb
│   └── my_services.rb
├── spec/
└── my_services.gemspec
```

**Usage in Rails apps:**
```ruby
# Gemfile
gem 'my_services', path: '../my_services'  # local development
gem 'my_services', git: 'https://github.com/user/my_services'  # git repo
gem 'my_services', '~> 1.0'  # published gem
```

## **2. Rails Engine (For More Complex Sharing)**

If you need to share models, controllers, views, and services:

```bash
rails plugin new shared_components --mountable
```

## **3. Git Submodules (Alternative)**

```bash
# In each Rails app
git submodule add https://github.com/user/shared_services lib/shared_services

# Load in application.rb
config.autoload_paths += %W(#{config.root}/lib/shared_services)
```

## **4. Private Gem Server**

For company-internal gems:
- **Gemfury** (hosted)
- **Geminabox** (self-hosted)
- **GitHub Packages**

## **Best Practices:**

1. **Namespace your services**: `MyCompany::SystemInfoService`
2. **Version carefully**: Use semantic versioning
3. **Document well**: README with usage examples
4. **Test thoroughly**: Each app may use services differently
5. **Keep dependencies minimal**: Avoid heavy Rails dependencies if possible

Creating a gem is definitely the Rails-idiomatic approach for sharing service objects across applications.

---

**User** (*2025-10-23*)

So I don't have to publish the gem, it can just be in github?

---

**Assistant** (*2025-10-23*)

Exactly! You don't need to publish to RubyGems.org. GitHub (or any git repository) works perfectly for private/internal gems.

## **GitHub Gem Usage:**

```ruby
# Gemfile
gem 'my_services', git: 'https://github.com/username/my_services'

# Specific branch/tag
gem 'my_services', git: 'https://github.com/username/my_services', branch: 'main'
gem 'my_services', git: 'https://github.com/username/my_services', tag: 'v1.2.0'

# Private repos (with SSH)
gem 'my_services', git: 'git@github.com:username/my_services.git'
```

## **Benefits of Git-Based Gems:**

1. **Private**: Keep internal business logic confidential
2. **Free**: No need for private gem hosting
3. **Version Control**: Use git tags for versioning
4. **Team Access**: Use GitHub's permission system
5. **CI/CD**: Run tests on GitHub Actions

## **Workflow:**

```bash
# Create gem
bundle gem company_services
cd company_services

# Push to GitHub
git remote add origin git@github.com:company/company_services.git
git push -u origin main

# Tag releases
git tag v1.0.0
git push --tags
```

## **Local Development:**

```ruby
# Use local path during development
gem 'company_services', path: '../company_services'

# Switch to git for production
gem 'company_services', git: 'git@github.com:company/company_services.git'
```

This approach is very common for internal company gems, shared utilities, and private business logic. Much simpler than setting up a private gem server!
